Kernel Configuration

If needed, enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile
the kernel:

Device Drivers --->
  <*/m> Sound card support --->                  [CONFIG_SOUND]
    <*/m> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ---> [CONFIG_SND]
            Select settings and drivers appropriate for your hardware.
    < >   Open Sound System (DEPRECATED)         [CONFIG_SOUND_PRIME]

In the Device Drivers ⇒ Sound card support ⇒ Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
section of the kernel configuration, select the settings and drivers appropriate
for your hardware. Ensure that the deprecated Device Drivers ⇒ Sound card support
⇒ Open Sound System is not selected. If necessary, recompile and install your new
kernel.
