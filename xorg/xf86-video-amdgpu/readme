Note

For Direct Rendering to work, you need to enable the radeonsi Gallium driver
at Mesa-18.1.6 build time. Also, all cards require Firmware to be available
when the kernel driver is loaded.


Kernel Configuration

Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
kernel if necessary:

Device Drivers  --->
  Graphics support --->
   <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support) ---> [CONFIG_DRM]
   <*/M> AMD GPU                                           [CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU]
    [ /*] Enable amdgpu support for SI parts               [CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU_SI]
    [ /*] Enable amdgpu support for CIK parts              [CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU_CIK]

The last two options enable experimental support for Southern and Sea Islands AMD GPUs
so they can be used with this driver. Note that the support is marked experimental and
disabled by default. Xorg ATI Driver-18.0.1 should be used for those GPUs.
Kernel Configuration for additional firmware

If you need to add firmware, install the file(s) and then point to them in the kernel
configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary. To find out which firmware you need,
consult the Decoder ring for engineering vs marketing names. Download any firmware for
your card which is named like: <ENGINEERING_NAME>_rlc.bin, etc. Below is an example for
Radeon R7 M340 GPU, which is codenamed Iceland/Topaz, along with a network card that also
requires the firmware:

CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="amdgpu/topaz_ce.bin amdgpu/topaz_k_smc.bin amdgpu/topaz_mc.bin
                       amdgpu/topaz_me.bin amdgpu/topaz_mec2.bin amdgpu/topaz_mec.bin
                       amdgpu/topaz_pfp.bin amdgpu/topaz_rlc.bin amdgpu/topaz_sdma1.bin
                       amdgpu/topaz_sdma.bin amdgpu/topaz_smc.bin rtl_nic/rtl8168e-3.fw"
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"


Note

CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE should all be on one line. It is shown above as multiple lines for
presentation only.
Tip

You can check dmesg output after boot to see which firmware is missing.

Alternatively, if you change CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU to '=m' in your linux kernel .config the
firmware can be loaded automatically from /lib/firmware/amdgpu/ when it installs the module.
This offers a tiny space saving, but also means that the screen will be blank for a longer
time before the framebuffer appears. Distros take this approach because it is not practical
to specify every possible firmware and the kernel would be excessively big.
