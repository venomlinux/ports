Note

The new “Maxwell” and “Pascal” GPUs require Glamor to be built with the Xorg server.

Kernel Configuration

Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary:

Device Drivers  --->
  Graphics support --->
   <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support) ---> [CONFIG_DRM]
   <*> Nouveau (NVIDIA) cards                              [CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU]
      [*]   Support for backlight control                     [CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU_BACKLIGHT]


Glamor Acceleration

Glamor is an acceleration library which uses cards' 3D capabilities to accelerate 2D rendering.
Glamor acceleration is enabled by default for the new “Maxwell” GPU's. According to the
documentation, Glamor acceleration can be used with other chips as well, but that does not
seem functional yet.

If you want anyway to try to enable Glamor for GPU's other than the new “Maxwell” ones, create
the following file as the root user:

cat >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf << "EOF"
Section "Device"
        Identifier "nvidia"
        Driver "nouveau"
        Option "AccelMethod" "glamor"
EndSection
EOF
