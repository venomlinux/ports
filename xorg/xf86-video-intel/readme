Kernel Configuration:

Enable the following options in the kernel configuration. Only one of the lines
“Intel I810” or “Intel 8xx/9xx...” needs to be selected. If you select the latter,
“Enable modesetting...” is needed too. Recompile the kernel if necessary:

Device Drivers  --->
  Graphics support --->
   <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support) ---> [CONFIG_DRM]
   <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics                   [CONFIG_DRM_I915]


Working around problems with the Intel driver:

The SandyBridge New Acceleration (SNA) code is intended to replace the old UXA (UMA
Acceleration Architecture), but it is a large body of code and sometimes causes
problems. In particular, when a system is built with gcc-5 and kernel headers from
linux-4.0, trying to run this driver using SNA has been known to segfault on some of
the supported chips. However, the version of the code in the version control system
listed above has been tested successfully with both SNA and UXA capabilities.

To work around this problem, as well as enabling support for UXA, it is necessary to
force UXA to be used by creating a configuration file. If this problem applies to
you, create the following file as the root user and modify it as needed:

cat >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf << "EOF"
Section   "Device"
        Identifier "Intel Graphics"
        Driver     "intel"
        #Option     "DRI" "2"            # DRI3 is default
        #Option     "AccelMethod"  "sna" # default
        #Option     "AccelMethod"  "uxa" # fallback
EndSection
EOF
