1- Configuration
====================
In order to get ccache working, you will need to prepend for each user( root, $USER...) /usr/local/bin to 
your PATH which is declared and read through .profile or .bash_profile.
you can achieve this by the following oneshot command( to be repeated each time you compile)
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH.
You can put the full PATH value in one of those files as well. This new value will be read at each connection. 

2- Checking
===================
You may check your new setup by the following command
which gcc # (cc, clang...)
It should return at least this value for gcc
/usr/local/bin/gcc
3- Results
====================
The first compilation will result in a normal time duration, but if you compile the same input the next
time, you will obtain a fairly reduced elapsed time duration.
Tested: Full Linux kernel compiling 45 minutes. Second compilation 8 minutes.
